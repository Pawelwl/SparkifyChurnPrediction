# SparkifyChurnPrediction

The objective of the project is to forecast churn of popular music streaming platform users. The dataset provided contains detailed information on events of users behavoiur on the platform, including among others the page they are on, the music they listen (artist, song title), users location and timestamp. <br>
The project uses **PySpark**. <br>
All the calculations are prepared in Jupyter Notebook "Sparkify.ipynb".
The Notebook is split into the following parts:
1. Import libraries, create Spark session
2. Load and Clean Dataset
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Feature Engineering
5. Modeling
6. Summary
